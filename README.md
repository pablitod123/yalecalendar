#Yale Calendar

Yale lacks a central listing for all of Yale's events; master's teas, open frat parties, performances, etc were missed. For instance, many students weren't aware that the founder of reddit held two events at Yale -- a open talk and a master's tea. I wasn't aware that the Lupita   Nyong'o, the oscar nominated actress from *12 Years a Slave*, or Captain Phillips, the survivor of the most famous Somali pirate hostage crisis, held master's teas. 

YCC attempted to address this issue with their [calendar](http://ycc.yale.edu/campus-calendar), but were unsuccessful due to poor implementation and the failure of event coordinators to post events. However, the YCC calendar, when in its listing format, is well-designed (though we see many potential improvements), but the home page for the calendar is unattractive/hard-to-use and thus does not lead users to continue navigating. Also, the mismatch between events actually occuring on campus and those listed on the calendar caused users to lose trust in the calendar as a trustworthy source of all possible events in a weekend. 

To improve the calendar, we will:

- allow users to add new events to the website (at a later point we'll make sure that only NetID users will be able to do this), including events that could not previously be added by an official group such as the YCC (for example, non-college-sponsored parties). 

- improve the actual formatting of the calendar with large, easy-to-read posts sorted by day that can be organized by category (Educational, Party, Music, Theater, etc.) or time of day.

- plan to pull from existing resources to take advantage of [already well designed calendars](http://yaledramacoalition.org/shows) specific to certain departments and student groups.
